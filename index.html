                <h4><a href="https://github.com/toritotony/hackathon2025">Web App with Interactive Map and CRUD Admin Portal</a></h4>
                <p>Two Web Applications utilizing JavaScript, PHP, HTML, CSS, and Oracle SQL to allow a non profit organization to authenticate into an admin center to input details of conservation properties, followed with an interactive dynamic map for their webpage that is based off the SQL database. This project was part of the HSU CS Club's annual hackathon, this year we focused on social good. </p><br/>

                <p>This web application is hosted by Streamlit and is responsible for providing retail investors with quick information on assets, stocks, sectors, and compares assets to help individuals make informed decisions</p><br/>
                <h4><a href="https://github.com/toritotony/Pinecone-Langchain-Search-Engine" class="header-link">Web Application for multimedia RAG</a></h4>
                <p>Python driven Flask application that allows the user to submit different forms of media (file, link-to-file, link-to-video) to "ask it" questions. Uses OpenAI's GPT 3.5 Turbo Model and was temporarily deployed with CI/CD through Github Actions and Azure Web Apps.</p><br/>
                <h4><a href="https://github.com/toritotony/OpenAI-Voice-Assistant" class="header-link">OpenAI Voice Activated Assistant</a></h4>
                <p>This Flask-based web application provides users the ability to input a voice recording through the device's microphone, and receive an audible output that reads a response given by OpenAI. Think of it as a verbal conversation with ChatGPT instead of textual.</p><br/>

                <p>Utilized Azure App Service and Web Apps, along with GitHub Actions to auto deploy flask-based web applications from development to production for every branch commit. It delegates authority to a service principal to execute this, and relies on stored secrets and API keys to run the required logic.</p><br/>

                <p>A repository that allows you to generate two bifurcation diagrams (2D and 3D versions) of the budworm population model, which is an adjusted version of the logistic population model. More information below which describes how we arrive at the equations that describe the bifurcation values in terms of the growth rate and maximum capacity. Keep in mind that we start by expressing our desire to search for equilibrium values by setting our ODE to zero. </p><br/>

                <p>During my first semester at Cal Poly Humboldt, I signed up and won a math competition hosted on campus, called an intgeration bee. This competition involves solving integrals, which are mathematical equations that have solving methods which are introduced in the first two semesters of Calculus.</p><br/>
                <h4><a href="https://github.com/toritotony/ODE-Slope-Fields" class="header-link">ODE Slope Field Generator Script</a></h4>
                <p>As a way to speed up the process of interpreting the long term behavior of a ordinary differential equation, I developed a python script which utilizes sympy and matplotlib to intepret a user-input as an equation and display a download-friendly plot which provides qualitative information on the equations.</p>
