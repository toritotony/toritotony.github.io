                <p>This low code solution leveraged Power Apps, Power Automate, and SharePoint Lists to allow department employees at the City of Long Beach to submit records relating to action items, accomplishments and notes for the City's 2030 Strategic Vision.</p><br/>

                <p>Utilized Azure App Service and Web Apps, along with GitHub Actions to auto deploy flask-based web applications from development to production for every branch commit. It delegates authority to a service principal to execute this, and relies on stored secrets and API keys to run the required logic.</p><br/>

                <p>Provided city managers with the ability to review grants submitted through Microsoft Forms while approving the grant request and assigning it to the next individual required to accept or reject. Can also restart approval through button in SharePoint list, and two flows run daily to check for granted awards and deadline dates.</p><br/>
